The recommeded guide for starting out in XR
## Step 1: PATH SELECTION:
So basically there are 3 paths that you start of with you have to chose one based on what you already know: 
So who are you?
  - A Web Developer: Your transition to XR would be a whole lot easier through WEBXR, main obstacle for you is going to be the shift from 2D to 3D and interaction handling
  - Game Developer: Wohoo! Your're already at 3D, but you need to go a little more into development in the backend side of XR
  - Mobile Developer: Apparently this is your playground, You can start with anything as you already have an introduction to everything.
I found an additional one for non-tech people as such
  - Designer: There is a lot of Design Thinking that goes into making an XR app so if you don't know how to code yet don't worry you will have plenty of time to catch up.

If you currently are not on any of these paths you can still pick on and make it your base as you move forward. Just basic introduction and thorough googling will get you through.
#### Note: Please take time to revise fundamentals.
